# Elm Scorekeeper

This is a basketball scorekeeper app based on the excellent [Elm For Beginners](http://courses.knowthen.com/courses/elm-for-beginners/) course.

I highly recommend the course if you want to get started with Elm and checkout [An Introduction to Elm](http://guide.elm-lang.org/) to learn more.

To run first install Elm by running ```npm install -g elm```

Then clone this repo, ```cd``` into the directory and run:

``` npm install ```, 
```elm-package install```
and
``` gulp ```
and then visit ```localhost:4000``` in your browser.
