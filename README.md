# Elm Scorekeeper

This is a basketball scorekeeper app based on the excellent [Elm For Beginners](http://courses.knowthen.com/courses/elm-for-beginners/) course.

I highly recommend the course if you want to get started with Elm and checkout [An Introduction to Elm](http://guide.elm-lang.org/) to learn more.

To run, clone this repo and run:

``` npm install ```
and
``` gulp ```
and then visit ```localhost:4000``` in your browser.
